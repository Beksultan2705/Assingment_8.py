# Assingment_8.py

1) The Employee_DB module creates a database to store information about employees, including their names, positions, salary, and date of employment. 
##I guess I should note that I used Parameterized queries which are used to ensure security and prevent SQL injections.

2) The main file "main.py" provides the user with an interface for interacting with the program. When launching the program, the user is offered a menu with several options.

1. View information about all employees
2. Add a new employee
3. Find the employee by ID
4. Update information about the employee
5. Delete the employee
6. Log out

The user can select the appropriate option, after which the program will perform the necessary actions, ensuring convenient and secure management of employee data.
